# Thesis

This master thesis consist of both Python code and PowerBI analysis. The scope of the project include three main subgoals, namely creating a cluster of countries, a vulnerability index and analyzing fatality data.
The purpose of the clustering algorithm is to group countries that make sense to compare with regards to climate-driven natural disasters. 
The EM-DAT database is filtered into a dataset without noisy data and only fatal, climate-driven events. This base-dataset is further modified and extended by merging other external datasets to achieve each of these subgoals.
